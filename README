	PHYSICS LIST
   
 	"Full" set of physics processes are registered, but via PhysicsConstructor
  	objects rather than complete pre-defined G4 physics lists. This alternative 
  	way gives more freedom to register physics.
  
  	PhysicsConstructors are either predefined G4 PhysicsConstructors or 'local'. 
  	They include : HadronElastic (including neutronHP), HadronInelastic,
  	IonsInelastic, GammaNuclear physics, RadioactiveDecay and Electomagnetic physics.
  	(see geant4/source/physics_lists/constructors)
 
 	ElectromagneticPhysics is a variante of EmStandard. No step constraint is imposed for 
 	energy loss mechanism (ionisation and brems). This is enough when spatial distribution
 	of deposited energy do not need to be accurate.
 	(see param->SetStepFunction(1., 1*mm))
 
  	Several hadronic physics options are controlled by environment variables.
  	To trigger them, an envHadronic.csh has been added in this example.
  	One must select the options wished, and do
        source envHadronic.csh  (or sh)
